         to support you in your dreams and aspirations, and to cherish every moment we share together.

        to understand you, and to love you unconditionally. I promise to laugh with you in times of joy
         and hold you close in times of sorrow. I promise to respect you, to honor you, and to always be
          honest with you. -->
